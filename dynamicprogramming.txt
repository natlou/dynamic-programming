A look at the importance of dynamic programming and the structure of this module.

Many recursive algorithms are brute-force in nature, i.e., they explore the entire solution space, which is exponential in terms of the problem size. Often, the recursive algorithms re-evaluate the same sub-problem over and over, which is inefficient. Dynamic programming is a technique that might be used to provide more efficient solutions to such problems.

Dynamic programming is a technique to provide an efficient solution to a problem by avoiding recomputations. It only works on problems that have repeating subproblems. It is something every developer should have in their toolkit.

In this module, you will get invaluable practice on some essential dynamic programming practice problems. This will help you prepare for dynamic programming-related problems that are commonly asked in JavaScript coding interviews.

Here are some of the problems that you will get practice on:

    Largest sum subarray

    Minimum coin change

    Levenshtein Distance

    Equal Subset Sum Partition

    Subset Sum

    Minimum Subset Sum Difference

    Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement

    Strings Interleaving

    Staircase

    Longest Bitonic Subsequence

    Minimum jumps to reach the end

    Minimum jumps with fee

    Number factors

The content is structured such that we provide you with a problem specification followed by a coding playground for you to attempt a solution. This is followed by a recommended solution.
